                        <h3>Works Completely Offline</h3>
                        <p>Once the AI model is downloaded, it works without internet. Import and process recipes anywhere - on a plane, camping, or with no cell signal.</p>

                        <p>Your recipe data never leaves your device for AI processing. We literally cannot see your recipes - and neither can anyone else.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Recipeez Difference:</strong> Other recipe apps send your data to cloud AI services like ChatGPT or Google, creating privacy risks and usage costs. Recipeez keeps everything local with our embedded Llama AI, giving you unlimited AI power with zero privacy compromise.</p>
